# System of Linear Equation Solver
* Use of kacmarz method  to solve the system of linear equations
* Kaczmarz method for solving linear systems of equations is an iterative algorithm based on gradient descent and line search with many applications
* Introducing  randomization in this method will make convergence faster
* More details here in the research paper [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/cs294docs/week1/09.Strohmer.pdf)
